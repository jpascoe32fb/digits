This project is based off of the New York Times (NYT) beta game - Digits. Digits was a math based game
hosted on NYT's website from April 10th to August 8th, 2023.

The rules for Digits are relatively simple. Each puzzle has a target number and 6 individual starting numbers that you must use in mathematical calculations to try and create the target number. Each of the 6 numbers can only be used once but the answer to a given math calculation becomes a new number to use. Once you finish a puzzle, the next button can be used to randomly generate the next puzzle. You obtain more points the more of the puzzles that you solve. The objective is to get as many points as possible.

This project is built from the combination of html, css, and javascript. To setup this project and deploy it yourself locally, all you have to do is clone the repository and use a local runtime environment like node.js to host the program. (ex. npm start)

The skeleton of this program was obtained from Github user conder13's digits repository. Multiple changes had to be made to accomidate for our version of the program, but his skeleton provided a helpful boost.

Reflection:
Throughout our design and development process, we encountered various hurdles and triumphs that shaped our collective experience. Reflecting on this journey, it is evident that effective communication and a willingness to collaborate were the cornerstones of our success.

One of the most significant challenges we faced was the merging of our contributions. Working on the same set of files meant that conflicts were an inevitable theme. Our initial method for merging, unfortunately, proved to be a stumbling block. The complexity of intertwining code and ideas often led to confusion and inefficiency. It required us to reevaluate our approach and find a more streamlined method. This challenge served as a valuable lesson, highlighting the importance of version control systems and collaborative tools that facilitate simultaneous editing without compromising the integrity of the project.

Despite this challenge, our group excelled at communication. We held regular meetings and replies were near instant. Each member came prepared, bringing their ideas, questions, and concerns to the table. This open dialogue not only fostered a sense of camaraderie, but also ensured that no one felt isolated or overwhelmed. The freedom to express thoughts and opinions allowed for creative brainstorming sessions, enabling us to explore innovative solutions to problems. Furthermore, the willingness of every team member to assist one another significantly contributed to the smooth progress of our project. Whenever someone encountered a roadblock, there was always a helping hand extended. This collaborative spirit created a positive and supportive environment where no idea was too insignificant to be considered. It fostered a sense of trust within the team, reinforcing the notion that we were all in this together.

Everyoneâ€™s voice was not only heard but genuinely listened to, and this inclusivity enhanced the richness of our project. Additionally, our punctuality and dedication to attending meetings ensured that there was a constant flow of information and progress updates. This punctuality, coupled with the openness to feedback and constructive criticism, played a pivotal role in our growth as a team.

In conclusion, our journey through the design and development process was a rollercoaster of experiences, showcasing both our strengths and areas for improvement. The challenges we faced with merging contributions illuminated the necessity of a well-thought-out version control strategy. On the other hand, our unwavering commitment to communication, collaboration, and mutual support were our biggest assets.

This project taught us that effective teamwork is not just about sharing the workload but also about fostering a culture of understanding, patience, and respect. It underscored the significance of adaptability and continuous learning in the face of challenges. As we move forward, these lessons will serve as guiding beacons, illuminating our path in future collaborative endeavors.
